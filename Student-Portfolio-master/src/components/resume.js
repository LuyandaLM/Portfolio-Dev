              <h1>About Me</h1>
              <h4>Full Name:</h4> Luyanda Mabozo
              <h4>Date of Birth:</h4> 27/05/1997
              <h4>Gender:</h4> Male
              <h4>Location (suburb):</h4> Summerville, Kuilsriver{" "}
              <h4>Nationality:</h4> South African Citizen
              <h4>Willing to relocate:</h4> No
              <h4>Any criminal record:</h4> No{" "}
              <h4>Are you blacklisted or do you have any credit issues?</h4> No
              <h4>Student Bio:</h4> I am a self-disciplined, responsible and
              patient individual who loves interacting and communicating with
              people. I am a very goal orientated person and believe that I can
              add value to all projects I am involved in by utilizing the skills
              I have acquired over the years as a stepping stone to achieving
              success. I live for self-growth and developing my skills further
              and these qualities will help me to achieve my future aspirations
              of becoming a full stack developer.{" "}
              <h4>Where does my passion for the tech space came from?</h4> In
              high school, I took CAT as a subject just to further my computer
              literacy and that is where I got my HTML knowledge. I bought
              myself a laptop in grade 11 and started video editing as my new
              skill because not only was I in love with the hardware parts of a
              computer or laptop, but I fell in love with the software part of
              things. I find it very fascinating to give instructions to a
              computer and it returns an outcome especially when it is something
              tangible. Programming is something I was very interested in as
              well and Iâ€™m glad that I found Life Choices Academy to nurture me.

                <li>Video editing</li>
